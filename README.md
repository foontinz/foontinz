My name is Dmytro, Dima for friends. CS student in Warsaw.                                    
Now I am working fulltime as a Software Engineer for more than a year now.                   
Previously freelanced in 2022-2023. 

- **Technologies**: Python, Golang, JS, Rust.
- **Domain**: Fin-tech, automation, platforms, game-dev.

But to be honest nothing above is set in stone as I do like to learn and try new things everyday, especially something intimidating like AI :D
